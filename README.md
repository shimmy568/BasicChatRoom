# BasicChatRoom
A basic chat room that I made on my free time to allow for chat over LAN or server deployed by anyone.

Project was made with the eclipse IDE. So just bring it into there and it should build fine with a modern version of Java. 

There are still many things that need to be implimented and is by no means finished (but on hold for the forseeable future). But still has most of the basic functionality for a chatroom application.
